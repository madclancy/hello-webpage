            <h2>Day in the Life</h2>
            <p>Peaches' day starts out by her climbing on top of her owners and meowing for attention and feeding. Once fed, she spends her day hanging out with her sister. They will play with their many toys, and scratch the couch. After a long day of playing, she cozies up for a midday nap in her favorite shoebox and awaits dinnertime. Post dinner, she makes sure she is always on someone's lap, and receiving constant pets. She'll end the day cozied up in bed, taking up an astonishing amount of space for such a small animal.</p>

            <h2>What She's Looking For</h2>
            <p>What Peaches is searching for is what we all want in life, a companion, friend, and fellow cat to share her little shoebox with. She is looking for loyalty, kindness, and someone who can provide. No cats over the age of ten please.</p>
